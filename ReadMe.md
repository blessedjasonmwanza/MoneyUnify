The shortcode will generate a payment form with fields for user details, including first name, last name, email, phone number, transaction details, and amount. Users can fill in these details and submit the form to initiate a payment.

## Handling Payments

When a user submits the payment form generated by the MoneyUnify shortcode, the following steps are performed:

1. The user's input data is validated and sanitized.
2. The order data is saved in the database.
3. A MoneyUnify API request is sent with the order details.
4. The API response is processed.
   - If the API request is successful, the order status is updated, and the user is redirected to a success page.
   - If the API request fails, an error message is displayed, and appropriate actions can be taken.
   
By default, the MoneyUnify plugin integrates with WooCommerce. When a successful payment is made, the order status in WooCommerce will be updated accordingly.

Note: Place the `[moneyunify]` shortcode on any page or post where you want to display the payment form. Users will be able to enter their payment details and complete the transaction.

That's it! You have successfully set up and configured the MoneyUnify plugin with WooCommerce. Users can now make payments using the MoneyUnify payment form generated by the shortcode.
